## Triple Technique Diagnosis using Machine Learned Classifiers

This repository contains the code for my research paper, "Triple Technique Diagnosis using Machine Learned Classifiers". The paper is linked [here](https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v6i10/ART20176765.pdf).

This project documents a study of four machine learned classifiers, namely, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and K-Nearest neighbour (KNN) on the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The performance of these algorithms has been analysed using classification accuracy and a confusion matrix. We have also introduced an ensemble of the above mentioned classifiers. The results show that the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron is far superior to other classifiers.
